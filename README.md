# Ntropy_test

In the file Ntropy_test I solve the first task which seemed to me the most relevant one. 
I've tried two approaches: 
* different clusterization technics of half-images
* GAN-inspired simple-CNN-binary-classification model to see if the image is fake or is similar to some MNIST image.

The second approach seems to work (at least I think so).  
As of time limitations (in the original tasks.txt) I designed some type of MVP that shows the functionality but is not optimized at all and I haven't tested it comprehensively.
Anyways, this is a cool and not standard task, I liked it.
